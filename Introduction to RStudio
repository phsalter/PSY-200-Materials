Throughout the semester, we will be learning and working with R and R Studio. Homework assignments are designed to give you practice with the programs in small doses, with weekly repeated practice. Sometimes the assignments will review things we learned in class; sometimes you will be asked to tackle new things on your own. 
Google is your friend. If you do not know/understand how to do something, try googling it! You can also work with a classmate, but make sure that BOTH of you ultimately understand how to do the task at the end. 
**You are encouraged to drop by office hours for our Class Tutor (Toffy) or email her with questions.

DO NOT WORRY if this does not make complete sense. We will be going slow with R in this course. This video is meant to give a brief overview of the RStudio panels. We will spend time in class on this as well.
